        <ul>
            <li>1 lbs lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 cut chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 minced garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons of dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 cup of water, broth, or red wine</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces of dried spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded parmasan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. 
                Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. <br>
                As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into 
                smaller crumbles.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, 
                until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic, and tomato paste and cook, stirring continuously 
                for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of 
                meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. <br> 
                Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. 
                Bring the sauce to a low simmer. <br>
                Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. 
                As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly.</li>
            <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a 
                large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package <br>
                directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested 
                cooking time.</li>
            <li>Take the sauce off of the heat. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave 
                for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. <br>
                Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
        </ol>
